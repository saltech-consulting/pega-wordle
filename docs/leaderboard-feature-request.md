## Current State Analysis

The Pega-Wordle application already has a robust leaderboard foundation:

### Existing Components
- **Leaderboard.jsx** - Complete UI component with rankings and hall of fame
- **scoreboardUtils.js** - Comprehensive scoring logic with user-based and global rankings
- **User profiles** - Individual player statistics and best games tracking
- **Series tracking** - 3-game series with performance metrics

### Existing Features
- Global rankings based on best series performance
- Hall of Fame with categories (Champion, Speed Demon, Most Efficient, Most Active)
- Individual user statistics and best games
- Series-based scoring system
- Performance metrics (attempts, time, completion rate)

## Enhancement Scope

### 1. Leaderboard Integration in Main App

**Current Gap**: The Leaderboard component exists but is not integrated into the main application flow.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- Add leaderboard navigation in the main header
- Create dedicated leaderboard view accessible from the game interface
- Show mini-leaderboard widget during game completion

### 2. Real-Time Leaderboard Updates

**Current Gap**: Leaderboard data may not reflect immediate changes after game completion.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- Automatically refresh leaderboard when users complete games
- Show position changes with animations
- Highlight when current user achieves new personal bests

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design

**Current Gap**: Leaderboard component needs CSS styling to match game aesthetics.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- Design leaderboard styles consistent with game theme
- Add responsive layout for booth display
- Include visual indicators for ranking changes
- Add avatars or player identification elements

## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure

- Efficient sorting and filtering for large player datasets
- Responsive updates without blocking game interface

### Accessibility
